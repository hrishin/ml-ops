# Iris Classifier MLOps Project

An end-to-end MLOps implementation for the Iris flower classification model, demonstrating best practices for model training, serving using local envrionment.

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple machine learning pipeline for Iris flower classification with a focus on MLOps practices. It includes:

- Training pipeline with preprocessing steps
- Model versioning and artifact management
- FastAPI service for model serving
- BDD testing using pytest-bdd and Poetry
- Basical makefile to perform SDLC
